In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.

- Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
- Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
- Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
- Dates are always objects
- Maths are always objects
- Regular expressions are always objects
- Arrays are always objects
- Functions are always objects
- Objects are always objects
 > All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.

## JavaScript Primitives
A primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods.

3.14 is a primitive value

A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value.

## JavaScript defines 7 types of primitive data types:

### Examples
- string
- number
- boolean
- null
- undefined
- symbol
- bigint

> Immutable
> Primitive values are immutable (they are hardcoded and cannot be changed).

> if x = 3.14, you can change the value of x, but you cannot change the value of 3.14.
