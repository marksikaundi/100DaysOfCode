# 100DaysOfCode Challenge

## Rules to Follow

1. Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.
3. Each day, you must work on a real project, not just tutorials.
4. If you miss a day, you must restart the challenge from day 1.

_Welcome to my 100 Days Of Code Challenge! This journey is all about committing to coding for 100 consecutive days to improve my programming skills and work on exciting projects. I will be documenting my progress and learning experiences day by day._

## Log

## Day 1: Setting up the Development Environment

Today, I set up my development environment. I installed my preferred code editor, set up version control with Git, and organized my project folders. I'm ready to start coding!

## Day 2-5: Learning Python Basics

For the next few days, I will be diving into Python. I'll be covering the basics, including variables, data types, control structures, and functions. Building a solid foundation is crucial!

## Day 6-10: Working on a To-Do List App

I've started working on a simple To-Do List application. I'll be using Python and a basic command-line interface to add, edit, and delete tasks. It's a practical way to apply what I've learned so far.

## Day 11-15: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

I'm delving into Object-Oriented Programming principles in Python. I'll be creating classes and objects, understanding inheritance, and exploring encapsulation and polymorphism.

## Day 16-20: Web Development Basics

Time to explore web development! I'll start with HTML and CSS to build static web pages. Then, I'll move on to JavaScript to add interactivity and responsiveness.

## Day 21-25: Building a Personal Website

I'm putting my web development skills to the test by creating my personal website. I'll showcase my projects, write a blog, and learn about web hosting and domain management.

## Day 26-30: Introduction to Frameworks

I'm diving into web development frameworks. I'll explore Flask for Python and create a simple web application. This will help me understand the power of frameworks.

## Day 31-35: Database Fundamentals

I'm learning about databases, focusing on SQL and relational databases. I'll design database schemas, write SQL queries, and connect my web app to a database.

## Day 36-40: API Integration

I'll learn how to interact with external APIs using Python. I'll build a weather app that fetches data from a weather API and displays it to the user.

## Day 41-45: Front-End Frameworks

I'll explore front-end frameworks like Reactjs and nextjs. I'll build a dynamic web application that communicates with a back-end server.

## Day 46-50: Deployment and DevOps

I'll delve into the world of deployment and DevOps. I'll learn about continuous integration, deployment pipelines, and deploy my projects to cloud platforms.

## Day 51-55: Security and Authentication

I'll focus on web security, including common vulnerabilities and best practices for securing web applications. I'll also implement user authentication in my projects.

## Day 56-60: Mobile App Development

I'll explore mobile app development using a framework React Native. I'll build a simple cross-platform mobile app.

## Day 61-65: Data Visualization

I'll dive into data visualization using libraries like Matplotlib and D3.js. I'll create interactive charts and graphs to analyze data.

## Day 66-70: Machine Learning Basics

I'll start learning about machine learning. I'll explore the basics of data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Day 71-75: Building a Machine Learning Model

I'll build my first machine learning model, such as a simple linear regression or classification model, and apply it to a real dataset.

## Day 76-80: Cloud Computing

I'll explore cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP. I'll deploy my projects to the cloud and learn about scalable infrastructure.

## Day 81-85: Advanced Topics

I'll explore advanced topics like microservices architecture, containerization with Docker, and serverless computing.

## Day 86-90: Open Source Contribution

I'll explore available open source projects to work on for 5days as part of my learning journey and contribute to them.

## Day 90-100: Coding interviews Challenge

This will be my remakable journey and i will finish the challeng with some coding challenges for 10days before i get to apply for some job openings.
