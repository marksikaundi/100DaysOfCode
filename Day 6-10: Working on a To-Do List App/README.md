## This file contains rules for my python TO DO list app
- Day one
**did setup the env**

Creating a simple to-do app in Python with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations is a great way to learn about basic data management and user interface development. I'll guide you through creating a command-line to-do app step by step. We'll use a simple text file to store the to-do list.

### Step 1: Setting up your Python environment

Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You may want to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies, but it's not strictly necessary for this small project.

### Step 2: Create a Python script

Create a new Python script, for example, todo_app.py. This will be the main file for your to-do app.

### Step 3: Create a simple text file for storing tasks

Create a text file, for example, tasks.txt, to store your to-do list items. You can initialize it with some sample tasks.

### Step 4: Implement the CRUD operations
